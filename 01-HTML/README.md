## The role of HTML
> -The Web is made out of three programming languages, HTML, CSS and Javascript.  
-the purpose of inventing the web is to provide a way for humanity to share content even when computers are different from each other ranging from old to new. It’s made possible by having three different kinds of programming languages, each doing part of the job.
> HTML|CSS|JAVASCRIPT
> -|-|-
> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language|CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets|JavaScript is a programming language
> It marks up the content of a site.<br>We can call up the pre-built functionality of web browsers through using certain HTML.|It provides visual styling and layout for everything on the web page|It creates more powerful interactivity
> -simple structure no programming logic, loops or functions <br> -declarative language|-bit more logic and computer science structure|
> -It’s resilience and robustness|-it’s a bit fragile and powerful and resilience|-most powerful and fragile
> -if something is missing or spelled wrong , it just guesses their meaning and fixes it and displays the page anyway.|-if something goes wrong , browsers skip that section and not apply that styling.|-if something wrong with the code , or the browser is too old to know what that code means , the browser stops and won’t run that javascript which make javascript more fragile.

> -Having all three languages means that developers can combine these qualities. Resilience, robustness and power.  
> -Do as much as possible in the more robust parts of the stack of these languages, and then use the rest of the stack to make the site better.

mark up-annotate or correct text for printing, keying, or typesetting

call up- if you call up information on a computer, you make the computer show it to you

declarative programming- It’s when you write your code in such a way that it describes what you want to do, and not how you want to do it.

declarative languages- also called non-procedural or very high level, are programming languages in which (ideally) a program specifies what is to be done rather than how to do it.

resilience- the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties

quite-absolutely; completely

leverage-use (something) to maximum advantage
## Chapter Quiz
> -Why is web or browser programming broken up into three parts?  
> choices|hints
> -|-
> 1-to execute as quickly as possible |Execution speed is secondary to function.
> 2-to accommodate multiple programming styles | Programming style is different from correctness or executability.
> ***3-to be resilient to changes in technology*** | ***Web pages should be forward-compatible.***
> 4-to be robust with respect to dates and years | Accommodating future dates is trivial but important.
>
> -when HTML is broken because of a bug in the code , The browser guesses what you meant, and does its best to fix the bug itself.

start over-make a new beginning

accommodate-to consider and include something in a design or plan , to provide with a place to live or to be stored in
