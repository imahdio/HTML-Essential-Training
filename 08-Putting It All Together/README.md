## The HTML page
>-HTML files are key building block of the web.  
-a user goes to a URL, hitting that URL sends a request for an HTML file, a server returns a single HTML file, the browser reads the HTML file and does what it says.  
-Text frequently is stored in a database or multiple static files often pull together the last millisecond, custom for each user. Visual styling is in CSS files, JavaScript is in separate JavaScript files, plus the images , video, audio files, advertisements.  
-When the browser gets html file, it immediately starts reading it from top to bottom and starts to do what it says.  
-Once the HTML file is built, there are several key parts that every web page must have.
>1. First, the file must start with a `<!doctype html>` , This little statement declares which era this HTML file is from. So by including this one, we tell the browser this is a modern web page, cut it with modern best practices.
>2. Then, we wrap everything else on the page with an `<html lang="en-US" dir="ltr">` element to declare which language we're going to use and in which direction the content should flow.
>3. Then inside `<html>` element , you have two major parts where everything goes. The `<head>` and the `<body>`. The `<head>` is for all the metadata, all the stuff about the document that a browser needs to know but will not be displayed on the page.
>4. the `body` element contains the information and content that will be displayed on the page.
