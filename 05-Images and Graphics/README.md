# 05-Images and Graphics
## Images
> -there are four attributes to include on every image element. 1-The source attribute, shortened to SRC. 2-The alt attribute, ALT. And 3-the width and 4-height attributes.
>```html
><img src="image.jpg" alt="black dog" width="400" height="300">
>```
>-The source attribute is what tells the browser which image file to load.  
-ALT attribute acts as a substitute for the image whenever the image can't be seen.  
-when leave the alt attribute blank , It'll be skipped over and nothing will be spoken aloud.  If we leave off the alt attribute instead, the image file name will get read aloud.  
-width and height attribute let the browser know how big the image is in pixels.  
-the order of attributes in an HTML element never matters, we can put them in whatever order we want.  
-if leave off the height and with attribute , browser has to get the size information after the image has fully downloaded. This in turn causes jumping around texts as images load.  
-*based on my test and tries* , when working with `<img>` element , following conditions can be occured  
>condition|result
>-|-
>Leave off both height and weight attributes|Image is loaded in its original actual size
>Keep both height and width attributes blank|Image is loaded in its original actual size
>one of size attributes are filled|image size will be changed proportionally
>Both size attributes are filled|image is loaded in its predefined layout

## Image formats
> -each image format uses a different technique for compressing the image to have the highest quality possible with the smallest file size possible.  
-There are 4 main file formats commonly used on the web today which each is good at compressing certain types of images.  
-gif pros and cons:  
> - One of the oldest image formats  
> - good at compressing illustrations with large areas of a single color  
> - Limited color space of 256 colors which bad choice for photographs  
> - Can be transparent with jagged edges  
> - Can have multiple frames and make animated gif  

>-svg pros and cons:
> - Great for logos , icons and other kinds of illustrations
> - SVGs are made of vector and math, ready to quite large or very small without ever losing any quality

> Notice: SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic, and it's a programming language for graphics.  
-jpg pros and cons:  
> - Great format for compressing photographs
> - Most digital cameras save photos that you shoot as JPG files
> - can be compressed to much smaller sizes, by simplifying the color information in the file. You can pick a balance between the quality and the file size.

> -png pros and cons:
> - newer format for the web than GIFs or JPGs
> - sometimes does a better job than a GIF or JPG at compressing the kind of images that the GIF or JPG format likes, but not always.
